# Game Of Life

A (very) basic implementation of Conway's Game of Life.  Uses https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne for the windowing toolkit and to render images to the screen.  Each tick of the simulation updates an in-memory image.RGBA and redraws.

Instructions on installing the dependencies needed to run Fyne on your system can be found here: https://fyne.io/develop/
